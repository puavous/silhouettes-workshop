# Demoscene intro as creativity incubator

- Demo: Audiovisual program working on some platform like Web Browser
- Intro: With an arbitrary limitation to executable size (e.g., 1024 or 4096 bytes)
- Must have few "primitive" building blocks and apply procedural generation
- Constraints in form foster creativity in content
- A usual trick in lateral thinking at large, "suppose we could only use paper clips to do this"
- This workshop is based on a 1k intro that placed 3rd in Assembly Summer 2023.

# Varjokuvia - silhouettes workshop

- True 3d with objects and camera
- BUT: The only primitive object is a "beam" of two balls connected as a convex capsule
- AND: You only see the "silhouette", i.e., one-colored 2D outline against a one-colored background
- CAN CREATE: Balls, thin beams, round capsules, pointy structures, organic shapes (see), ... a LOT of space for creative thinking!
- Now, let's do a 4-part intro together!
- Ideate together and ask help from your workshop teacher.

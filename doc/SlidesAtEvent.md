# About demoscene and 'intros'

- Demoscene is [digital culture](https://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/)
- Recent leaflet "Demo maker's handbook" [in English](https://efgamp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Demo-Makers-Handbook_en.pdf)
  and [in Finnish](https://www.postimuseo.fi/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/demoilijan_kasikirja_0623_A5_N.pdf)
- Academic exposition: Reunanen, M. (2017). [Times of Change in the Demoscene: A Creative Community and Its Relationship with Technology](https://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-29-6717-9). Dissertation. University of Turku.
- Cool events like [Assembly](https://assembly.org/) and [Instanssi](https://instanssi.org/)
- Competitions in various outputs of digital art
- Programming is needed in "demos" and "tiny demos" that are called "intros"

# Demoscene intro as creativity incubator

- Demo: Audiovisual program working on some platform like Web Browser
- Intro: With an arbitrary limitation to executable size (e.g., 1024 or 4096 bytes)
- Must choose few "primitive" building blocks and apply procedural generation
- Constraints in form foster creativity in content
- A usual trick in lateral thinking at large, "suppose we had to build it using only paper clips ..."
- Occasional sparring with hard constraints could make you better in solving any problems on a daily basis
- This workshop is based on a 1k intro that placed 3rd in Assembly Summer 2023, ["Memories from Pasila Woods"](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=94821).

# Varjokuvia - Silhouettes workshop

- True 3d with objects and camera
- BUT: The only primitive object is a "beam" of two balls connected as a convex capsule
- AND: You only see the "silhouette", i.e., one-colored 2D outline against a one-colored background
- CAN CREATE: Balls, thin beams, round capsules, pointy structures, organic shapes (like the trees in Pasila Woods), ... a LOT of space for creative thinking!
- Now, let's do a multi-part intro together!
- Ideate together and ask help from your workshop teacher.

# Co-creation

- One person in each group is the "coder" who handles typing and version control
- Others have an equally important role in fast-paced co-creation:
   + Discuss and suggest artistic ideas
   + Draft ideas on paper
   + Work with math and problem solving as needed, like coordinates, loop indices, radian degrees, code factoring ...
   + Search the web for help about Javascript, math, geometry, ...
   + Live-spot mistakes and "thinkos" that the coder is likely to do regularly (kin to pair-programming)

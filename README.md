# Varjokuvia - Silhouettes

Starter code for a 2-hour creative programming workshop; spin-off from lmad1 workshop library.

Starting with some selected copy-paste from earlier productions here and there (lmad1, browser1k)

Beta version as of now. It could go more or less like this.

## Instructions for workshop participants

Welcome to create some cool graphics together! Student instructions are simple:

1. Follow the local instructions given by your workshop teacher.

2. After teacher's preparation and instructions, one participant of each group
   would be the coder who clones the starter pack with lmad1 library:

   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules URL
   ```

   where URL is in fact a fork of the starter code - a specific fork for which
   the teacher has given read/write premissions to the selected coders.
   
3. Each group will then create their own part of a new artistic masterpiece.

4. At the end of the workshop, merge versions, and enjoy the parts combined on
   the big screen of your auditorium.

## Instructions for the workshop teacher

You do what you want, using your local systems - here is an example using our local gitlab installation at University of Jyväskylä:

1. Count your students.. Aim at 3 people in a group if possible: one coder and two artistic support persons

2. Fork a suitable number of projects: Ideally 4 groups work on one fork (i.e., 4x3=12 people). If you have 36 students, you'll be forking 3 projects. If you have less than 16 students (4x4=16), you'll only need one fork. If you have 6 students, maybe divide them to pairs instead of groups of 3. Go with the flow.. Cook up names like "ws-fork-tuesday-leftside". Be fast with this. 

3. Assign Developer right to the selected coder of each group.

4. Explain the context in 5 minutes - what is to be done, how, and why should they care (My future TODO: Presentation slides to make this easier for you.)

5. Be **really** wary about time - 2 hours goes by very fast when they're having fun.

6. Run, run, between the groups, giving help with programming, math, git, all surprising details that will unexpectedly turn up. ( My future TODO: One slide that recites '2*Math.PI' and 'for (var i=1; i<10; i++)' and other useful stuff that can be used)

7. Instruct merging and viewing the result once in-between and once at the end. Allow time for discussion.

## Example schedule

The following 2-hour pacing seems doable with a prepared teacher and students already familiar with command line git. Example happening at 10am:

~~~
    10:15 Sit down in groups, log into computers, Meet & greet
    10:20 Concept presentation: demoscene, intro, example code package
    10:40 Fork project, assign dev rights, clone & examine example
    10:45 Intense groupwork for 30 minutes
    11:15 Synchronize versions (commit, pull, push)
          making sure there will be no issues with final merge
    11:20 Intense groupwork for 30 minutes
    11:45 Synchronize versions again, and admire the production on screen
    11:50 Comments round and open discussion
    12:00 Bye.
~~~



## Future plans

It would be nice to have a couple of OK songs to choose from, according to
number of participants and their mood.. and an introductory slide show about
demoscene intros.. detailed teacher's instructions and other nice stuff.
Some day then. I'll be flinging this in November 2024 and see how it goes.

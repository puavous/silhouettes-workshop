# Varjokuvia - Silhouettes

Starter code for a 2-hour creative programming workshop; spin-off from lmad1 workshop library.

Starting with some selected copy-paste from earlier productions here and there (lmad1, browser1k)

## Instructions for workshop participants

Pilot version as of now. It could go more or less like this.

Early notes about possible how-tos:

Workshop teacher should fork the blank example repo, and make preparations
depending on number of people and groups.

After teacher's preparation and instructions, one participant of each group
would be the coder who clones the starter pack with lmad1 library:

  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/puavous/silhouettes-workshop.git

Others will work with the coder so that each group gets a cool visual for
their part of the show.

At the end of the workshop, merge versions, and enjoy the parts combined on
the big screen of your auditorium.

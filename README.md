# Varjokuvia - Silhouettes

Starter code for a 2-hour creative programming workshop; spin-off from lmad1 workshop library.

Starting with some selected copy-paste from earlier productions here and there (lmad1, browser1k)

Beta version as of now. It could go more or less like this.

## Instructions for workshop participants

Welcome to create some cool graphics together! Student instructions are simple:

1. Follow the local instructions given by your workshop teacher.

2. Wait until the workshop teacher forks the blank example repo and makes preparations
depending on the number of people and groups present today.

3. After teacher's preparation and instructions, one participant of each group
   would be the coder who clones the starter pack with lmad1 library:

   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules URL
   ```

   where URL is in fact a fork of the starter code - a specific fork for which
   the teacher has given read/write premissions to the selected coders.
   
4. You will now jointly create a new artistic masterpiece.

   Others will work with the coder so that each group gets a cool visual for
   their part of the show. Important things in supporting roles:

   - Discuss artistic ideas

   - Draft ideas on paper

   - Work with the math as needed, like coordinates, loop indices, radian degrees ...

   - Search the web for help about Javascript, math, geometry, ...

   - Live-spot mistakes and "thinkos" that the coder is likely to do regularly (kin to pair-programming)

5. At the end of the workshop, merge versions, and enjoy the parts combined on
   the big screen of your auditorium.

## Instructions for the workshop teacher

You do what you want, using your local systems - here is an example using our local gitlab installation at University of Jyväskylä:

1. Count your students.. Aim at 3 people in a group if possible: one coder and two artistic support persons

2. Fork a suitable number of projects: Ideally 4 groups work on one fork (i.e., 4x3=12 people). If you have 36 students, you'll be forking 3 projects. If you have less than 16 students (4x4=16), you'll only need one fork. If you have 6 students, maybe divide them to pairs instead of groups of 3. Go with the flow.. Cook up names like "ws-fork-tuesday-leftside". Be fast with this. 

3. Assign Developer right to the selected coder of each group.

4. Explain the context in 5 minutes - what is to be done, how, and why should they care (My future TODO: Presentation slides to make this easier for you.)

5. Be **really** wary about time - 2 hours goes by very fast when they're having fun.

6. Run, run, between the groups, giving help with programming, math, git, all surprising details that will unexpectedly turn up. ( My future TODO: One slide that recites '2*Math.PI' and 'for (var i=1; i<10; i++)' and other useful stuff that can be used)

7. Instruct merging and viewing the result once in-between and once at the end. Allow time for discussion.

## Future plans

It would be nice to have a couple of OK songs to choose from, according to
number of participants and their mood.. and an introductory slide show about
demoscene intros.. detailed teacher's instructions and other nice stuff.
Some day then. I'll be flinging this in November 2024 and see how it goes.
